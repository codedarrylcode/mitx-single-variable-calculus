    "Recall that the **average rate of change** of a function $x(t)$ over an interval $[a, b]$ is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\text{Average rate of change} = \\frac{x(b) - x(a)}{b-a} = \\frac{\\text{Rise}}{\\text{Run}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly we can represent the average rate of change geometrically by the slope of the secant line through the points $(a, x(a)), (b, x(b))$\n",

    "**Definition**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Mean Value Theorem** states that there is a point $c$, such that $a < c < b$, at which the tangent line is parallel to the secant line, i.e. the slope of both lines equal. This is true if $x(t)$ is continuous on the closed interval $[a, b]$ and differentiable on the open interval $(a, b)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can represent this mathetmatically as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{x(b) - x(a)}{b - a} = x'(c)$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the $\\text{LHS}$ computes the average rate of change between the interval $[a, b]$ and the $\\text{RHS}$ computes the instantaneous rate of change at point $c$.\n",

    "Suppose $f$ is a continuous, differentiable function. If $f'$ is never zero and $a \\neq b$, then show $f(a) \\neq f(b)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a} = f'(c)$ for $a < c < b$ and we want to prove $f(b) - f(a)$ is never zero\n",
    "\n",
    "$f(b) - f(a) = f'(c) \\cdot (b-a)$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since $f'$ and $b - a$ are non-zero then the product of $f'(c) \\cdot (b-a)$ is non-zero and proves that $f(b) - f(a)$ is non-zero as well\n",
