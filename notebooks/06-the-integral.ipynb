    "In other words, a lower bound on the derivative is also a lower bound on the average rate of change and similarly for the upper bound.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since $(b-a) > 0$, multiplying the inequality on both sides will not change the inequality signs and we get the following inequality of the total change of the function:\n",

    "Sometimes we know the maximum and minimum values of $x'(t)$ and in this case we can use the lowest upper bound on the derivative and the greatest lower bound on $x'(t)$ and obtain the following inequality for the average rate of change:\n",
